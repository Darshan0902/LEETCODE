# Creating a Pivot Table from Weather Data

## Intuition
The task seems to involve creating a pivot table from a DataFrame containing weather data.

## Approach
To create a pivot table, I would use the `pivot` function provided by Pandas. By specifying the index, columns, and values parameters appropriately, we can reshape the DataFrame into a pivot table where rows represent months, columns represent cities, and values represent temperatures.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The time complexity depends on the size of the input data and the operation performed by the `pivot` function.
- Space complexity: $$O(m \times c)$$, where $$m$$ is the number of unique months and $$c$$ is the number of unique cities in the input DataFrame. The space complexity depends on the size of the resulting pivot table.

## Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def pivotTable(weather: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    weather = pd.pivot(weather, index="month", columns='city', values='temperature')
    return weather
