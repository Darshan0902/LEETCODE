# Intuition
This problem seems to involve selecting the first few rows of a DataFrame. The task specifically asks for selecting the first 3 rows. We can use the head() function provided by Pandas to accomplish this.

# Approach
To select the first 3 rows of the DataFrame, we'll use the head() function with an argument of 3. This function returns the first n rows of the DataFrame, where n is the argument passed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The head() function retrieves the first few rows of the DataFrame, which takes constant time, regardless of the size of the DataFrame.
Overall time complexity is 
O(1).
- Space complexity:
The space complexity depends on the size of the DataFrame returned. Since we're returning the first 3 rows, the space complexity is 
O(1).
# Code

This function selectFirstRows takes a Pandas DataFrame employees as input and returns a new DataFrame containing only the first 3 rows.
```.py
import pandas as pd

def selectFirstRows(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return(employees.head(3))
```
