# Intuition
The task appears to involve changing the datatype of a column named 'grade' in a DataFrame of students to integers.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use the `astype` method provided by Pandas. By specifying the desired datatype ('int' in this case), we can convert the 'grade' column to integers. This operation directly modifies the DataFrame in place.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$, since converting the datatype of a column to integers does not depend on the size of the DataFrame. It's a constant time operation.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, since changing the datatype of a column does not require additional memory allocation proportional to the size of the DataFrame.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def changeDatatype(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    students['grade'] = students['grade'].astype(int)
    return students
