# Intuition
The problem seems to involve concatenating two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) into a single DataFrame.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use the `pd.concat()` function provided by Pandas. This function concatenates DataFrames vertically (i.e., stacking them on top of each other). By passing a list containing both DataFrames (`[df1, df2]`), we can concatenate them into a single DataFrame.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m + n)$$, where $$m$$ is the number of rows in `df1` and $$n$$ is the number of rows in `df2`. The time complexity depends on the total number of rows in both DataFrames since we need to iterate through all rows during concatenation.
- Space complexity: $$O(m + n)$$, where $$m$$ is the number of rows in `df1` and $$n$$ is the number of rows in `df2`. The space complexity is proportional to the total number of rows in both DataFrames.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def concatenateTables(df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.concat([df1, df2])
