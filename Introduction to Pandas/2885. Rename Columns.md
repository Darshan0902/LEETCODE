# Intuition
The problem seems to involve renaming columns in a DataFrame of students.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use the `rename` method provided by Pandas. By specifying a dictionary mapping old column names to new column names, we can rename the columns as required. Since we're modifying the DataFrame in place, there's no need to assign the result back to a variable.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$, since the time complexity of renaming columns does not depend on the size of the DataFrame. It's a constant time operation.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, since renaming columns does not require additional memory allocation proportional to the size of the DataFrame.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def renameColumns(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    students.rename(columns={'id': 'student_id', 'first': 'first_name', 'last': 'last_name', 'age': 'age_in_years'}, inplace=True)
    return students
