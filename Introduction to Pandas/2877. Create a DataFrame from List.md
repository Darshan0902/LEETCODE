# Intuition
This problem is about creating a DataFrame, a tabular data structure, from a 2D list that contains the IDs and ages of some students. Let's break down the steps:

Understanding the Input: We're given a 2D list called student_data, where each inner list represents a student's information. The first element in each inner list is the student's ID, and the second element is their age.

Creating the DataFrame: We want to convert this 2D list into a DataFrame with two columns: 'student_id' and 'age'. Each row of the DataFrame will correspond to a student's information.

Order of the DataFrame: It's important to maintain the same order as the original 2D list. This means the first row in the DataFrame should correspond to the first inner list in the student_data, the second row to the second inner list, and so on.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

We'll use the Pandas library in Python to create the DataFrame. Pandas provides a DataFrame() constructor that can take a 2D list as input and create a DataFrame from it.

We'll specify the column names as 'student_id' and 'age' while creating the DataFrame to ensure the columns are named correctly.

Finally, we'll return the DataFrame as the output of our function.

For beginners, understanding this problem involves grasping the concept of a DataFrame and how it's created from tabular data. They need to understand that each row of the DataFrame corresponds to a record (in this case, a student's information), and each column represents a different attribute of that record (such as student ID and age). Additionally, beginners should understand how to use the Pandas library to perform operations like creating DataFrames from different types of data structures. Overall, this problem serves as a good exercise in basic data manipulation using Pandas.



# Approach
We'll use the pd.DataFrame() constructor provided by Pandas to create the DataFrame. We'll pass the list of student data and specify the column names as 'student_id' and 'age' while creating the DataFrame.
# Complexity


- Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of students in the input list. Constructing the DataFrame involves iterating over the input list once.

- Space complexity: 
O(n), where n is the number of students in the input list. The space complexity is dominated by the space required to store the DataFrame.
# Code
```.py
import pandas as pd
def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.DataFrame(student_data,columns=['student_id','age'])

```



This function createDataframe takes a list of student data as input and returns a Pandas DataFrame with columns 'student_id' and 'age'.
