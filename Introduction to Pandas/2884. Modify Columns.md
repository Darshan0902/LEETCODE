# Intuition
The task appears to involve modifying the 'salary' column in a DataFrame of employees by doubling each salary value.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use Pandas to directly modify the 'salary' column. By multiplying each value in the 'salary' column by 2, we can effectively double the salary for each employee.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The time complexity is linear since it involves iterating through each row to modify the 'salary' column.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ if the returned DataFrame is not considered, or $$O(n)$$ if considering the returned DataFrame, where $$n$$ is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The space complexity is constant if the original DataFrame is modified in place, otherwise linear in the number of rows if a new DataFrame is returned.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def modifySalaryColumn(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employees['salary'] = employees['salary'] * 2
    return employees
