# Intuition
The problem likely involves filtering data based on certain criteria, specifically selecting rows where the student ID is 101.

# Approach
Your approach seems to use the Pandas library to filter a DataFrame. You're selecting rows where the student ID is 101 and extracting only the 'name' and 'age' columns.
# Complexity

* Time complexity: 
O(n), where n is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. Filtering rows based on a condition typically requires scanning through each row once.

* Space complexity: 
O(1) if the returned DataFrame is not considered, or 
O(m) if considering the returned DataFrame, where 
𝑚 is the number of selected rows.

# Code
```
import pandas as pd

def selectData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return students.loc[students['student_id']==101,['name','age']]
```
