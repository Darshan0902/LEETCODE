# Intuition
The problem seems to involve filling missing values in the 'quantity' column of a DataFrame of products, replacing them with zeros.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use the `fillna` method provided by Pandas. By specifying the value to fill missing values with (0 in this case), we can replace any NaN values in the 'quantity' column with zeros. Since we're not modifying the DataFrame in place, the `inplace` parameter is set to `False`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$, since filling missing values with a constant value does not depend on the size of the DataFrame. It's a constant time operation.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, since filling missing values with a constant value does not require additional memory allocation proportional to the size of the DataFrame.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def fillMissingValues(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    products["quantity"] = products["quantity"].fillna(0, inplace=False)
    return products
