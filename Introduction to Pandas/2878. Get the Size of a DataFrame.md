# Intuition
The task appears to involve finding the size of a DataFrame, which likely means determining the number of rows and columns it contains. This can be accomplished using Pandas DataFrame attributes.
# Approach
To find the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame, we can use the axes attribute of the DataFrame object. The axes[0] gives the row axis and axes[1] gives the column axis. We'll simply take the length of these axes to find the number of rows and columns.


# Complexity
- ## Time complexity:
Accessing the axes attribute of the DataFrame takes constant time.
Finding the length of the axes requires traversing the axes once, so it's linear in the number of axes.
Overall time complexity is 
O(n), where n is the maximum of the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.

- ## Space complexity:
We are only storing the lengths of rows and columns, so the space complexity is constant, i.e., 
O(1).

# Code : 

This function getDataframeSize takes a Pandas DataFrame players as input and returns a list containing the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.

```.py
import pandas as pd

def getDataframeSize(players: pd.DataFrame) -> List[int]:
    rows = len(players.axes[0])
    cols = len(players.axes[1])
    return [rows,cols]
```
