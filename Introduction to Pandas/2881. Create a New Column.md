# Intuition
The task seems to involve adding a new column named 'bonus' to a DataFrame of employees, where the bonus is twice the value of the 'salary' column for each employee.
# Approach
Your approach is to use Pandas to manipulate the DataFrame directly. You're adding a new column named 'bonus' by multiplying the 'salary' column by 2 for each employee.
# Complexity

- Time complexity: 
O(n), where 
n is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The time complexity is linear because it involves iterating through each row once to compute the bonus.

- Space complexity: 
O(1) if the returned DataFrame is not considered, or 
O(n) if considering the returned DataFrame, where 
𝑛 is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The space complexity is constant if the original DataFrame is modified in place, otherwise linear in the number of rows if a new DataFrame is returned.

# Code
```
import pandas as pd

def createBonusColumn(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employees['bonus'] = employees['salary']*2
    return employees
```
