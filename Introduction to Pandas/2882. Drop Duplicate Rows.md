# Intuition
The problem seems to involve removing duplicate entries based on the 'email' column in a DataFrame of customers.

# Approach
To solve this problem, I would use the `drop_duplicates` method provided by Pandas. By specifying the 'email' column as the subset, we can remove duplicate rows based on that column. Since we're modifying the DataFrame in place, there's no need to assign the result back to a variable.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The time complexity depends on the number of rows.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of rows in the input DataFrame. The space complexity is proportional to the number of unique email addresses.

# Code
```python
import pandas as pd

def dropDuplicateEmails(customers: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    customers.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'], inplace=True)
    return customers
```
