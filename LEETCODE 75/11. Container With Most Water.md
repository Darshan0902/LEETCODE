To solve the problem of finding the two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `height`.

### Two-Pointer Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.

2. **Calculate Area**:
   - Calculate the area formed between the lines at the `left` and `right` pointers using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \min(\text{height}[left], \text{height}[right]) \times (\text{right} - \text{left})
     \]
   - Update the maximum area found so far.

3. **Move Pointers**:
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line, because the area is limited by the shorter line, and moving the taller line would not increase the area.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue the process until the `left` pointer meets the `right` pointer.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code for this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            # Calculate the area with the current left and right pointers
            current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

            # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_area
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` is initialized to 0.
   - `right` is initialized to the last index of the array.
   - `max_area` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum area found.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `left` is less than `right`.
   - The area is calculated using the current values of `left` and `right`.
   - `max_area` is updated to the maximum of the current area and `max_area`.

3. **Pointer Movement**:
   - If the height at `left` is less than the height at `right`, increment the `left` pointer.
   - Otherwise, decrement the `right` pointer.
   - This ensures that we are always looking for potentially larger areas by considering the taller lines.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `left` is no longer less than `right`.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum area efficiently by leveraging the two-pointer technique, which reduces the problem from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n)\).
