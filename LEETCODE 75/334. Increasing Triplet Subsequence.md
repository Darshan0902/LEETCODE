# Intuition
We can solve this problem by iterating through the array and keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far. If we encounter a number greater than both of these, we have found our increasing triplet subsequence.

# Approach
1. Initialize two variables, `first` and `second`, to represent the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far, respectively. Set them to positive infinity.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`.
3. If the current element is less than `first`, update `first` to the current element.
4. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than `first` but less than `second`, update `second` to the current element.
5. If the current element is greater than both `first` and `second`, return True, as we have found an increasing triplet subsequence.
6. If we reach the end of the array without finding such a triplet, return False.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \( n \) is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$. We use only a constant amount of extra space for storing variables `first` and `second`. 

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = float('inf')
        second = float('inf')
        
        for num in nums:
            if num <= first:
                first = num
            elif num <= second:
                second = num
            else:
                return True
        
        return False
```
