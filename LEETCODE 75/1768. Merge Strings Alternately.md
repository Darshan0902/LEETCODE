# Intuition
The problem asks to merge two strings alternately. Therefore, we can traverse both strings at the same time and pick each character alternately from both strings.

# Approach
- Initialize an empty string to store the merged result.
- Traverse both input strings together, picking each character alternately from both strings and appending it to the merged result string.
- Continue the traversal until the end of the longer string is reached.
Return the merged result string.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
Since we traverse both strings once and pick each character alternately, the time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

- Space complexity:
We use a StringBuilder to store the merged string, so the space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

# Code
```.python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(word1) or i < len(word2):
            if i < len(word1):
                result.append(word1[i])
            if i < len(word2):
                result.append(word2[i])
            i += 1
        return ''.join(result)
```
