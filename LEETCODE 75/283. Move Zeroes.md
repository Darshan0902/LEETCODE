To solve the problem of moving all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements, we can use a two-pointer technique. This approach ensures we achieve the desired result in-place with minimal operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a `lastNonZeroFoundAt` pointer to keep track of the position where the next non-zero element should be moved.

2. **Traverse the array**:
   - Iterate through the array using a `current` pointer.
   - For each non-zero element found, place it at the `lastNonZeroFoundAt` position and then increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.
   - This will ensure all non-zero elements are shifted to the beginning of the array while maintaining their relative order.

3. **Fill remaining positions with zeros**:
   - After placing all non-zero elements, fill the remaining positions in the array (from `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to the end) with zeros.

This method ensures that all operations are done in one pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a few extra variables.

Here is the Python code for this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0

        # Move all non-zero elements to the beginning of the array
        for current in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[current] != 0:
                nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt] = nums[current]
                lastNonZeroFoundAt += 1

        # Fill the remaining positions with zeros
        for i in range(lastNonZeroFoundAt, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0
```

### Explanation:

1. **Move non-zero elements**:
   - We iterate through the array using the `current` pointer.
   - Each time a non-zero element is encountered, it is placed at the position indicated by `lastNonZeroFoundAt`, and `lastNonZeroFoundAt` is incremented.
   
2. **Fill with zeros**:
   - After all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning, the positions from `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to the end of the array are filled with zeros.

This approach ensures that the array is modified in-place without using additional space for another array, thus meeting the problem's constraints effectively.
