# Intuition
To reverse the order of words in the given string, we can split the string into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. Then, we can reverse the order of the words and join them back together with a single space separator.

# Approach
1. Split the string into words using the split() method.
2. Reverse the list of words using the reverse() method.
3. Join the reversed words into a string using the join() method with a single space separator.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \( n \) is the length of the input string \( s \). Splitting the string and joining the words take linear time.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \( n \) is the length of the input string \( s \). Additional space is used to store the list of words.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Split the string into words using whitespace as delimiter
        words = s.split()
        
        # Reverse the order of words
        words.reverse()
        
        # Join the reversed words with a single space as separator
        return ' '.join(words)

```
