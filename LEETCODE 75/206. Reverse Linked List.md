To reverse a singly linked list, we need to change the direction of the `next` pointers of all the nodes. This can be efficiently done using an iterative approach with three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next_node`.

### Steps to Reverse the Linked List

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - `prev` is initially set to `None`.
   - `curr` is initially set to the head of the list.
   - `next_node` is used to temporarily store the next node of `curr` during the iteration.

2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - While `curr` is not `None`, perform the following steps:
     - Save the next node of `curr` in `next_node`.
     - Reverse the link by making `curr.next` point to `prev`.
     - Move `prev` and `curr` one step forward.
   
3. **Update the Head**:
   - After the loop, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.
   - Return `prev` as the new head.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr is not None:
            next_node = curr.next  # Save the next node
            curr.next = prev       # Reverse the link
            prev = curr            # Move prev to current
            curr = next_node       # Move curr to next node
        
        return prev  # prev will be the new head of the reversed list
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition**:
   - `ListNode` class defines the structure of a node in the linked list.
   - `Solution` class contains the method `reverseList`.

2. **Method `reverseList`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `prev` is set to `None` to indicate the end of the reversed list.
     - `curr` is set to the head of the list.
   - **Iteration**:
     - While `curr` is not `None`, perform the following operations:
       - Save the next node of `curr` in `next_node`.
       - Set `curr.next` to `prev` to reverse the link.
       - Move `prev` to `curr`.
       - Move `curr` to `next_node`.
   - **Return**:
     - After the loop, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed list.
     - Return `prev`.

This approach ensures that we reverse the linked list in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the list. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
