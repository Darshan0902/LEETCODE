Let's break down the problem and the solution provided, analyzing the approach and its complexity.

### Problem Analysis
We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the contiguous subarray of length `k` that has the maximum average and return that average.

### Approach
The solution uses a sliding window technique:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements. This sum serves as the initial maximum sum (`max_sum`) and the current window sum (`cur`).
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Iterate through the array from the `k`-th element to the end.
   - For each position `i`, update the current window sum by subtracting the element that is going out of the window (`nums[i]`) and adding the element that is coming into the window (`nums[i + k]`).
   - If the new window sum is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum`.
3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The maximum average is calculated by dividing the `max_sum` by `k`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Calculating the initial sum of the first `k` elements takes \(O(k)\).
  - Iterating through the rest of the elements (i.e., `n - k` iterations) and updating the current sum takes \(O(n - k)\). 
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The solution uses a constant amount of additional space for variables (`max_sum` and `cur`), resulting in a space complexity of \(O(1)\).

### Solution Code
Here is the provided solution with comments for better understanding:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Calculate the sum of the first k elements
        max_sum = cur = sum(nums[:k])
        
        # Slide the window across the array
        for i in range(len(nums) - k):
            # Update the current sum by subtracting the element that goes out of the window
            # and adding the new element that comes into the window
            cur = cur - nums[i] + nums[i + k]
            
            # Update max_sum if the new current sum is larger
            if cur > max_sum:
                max_sum = cur
        
        # Calculate the maximum average
        return max_sum / k
```

### Conclusion
The sliding window technique efficiently finds the contiguous subarray of length `k` with the maximum average in linear time, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
