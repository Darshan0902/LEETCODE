To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of operations that can be performed to remove pairs from the array whose sum equals \( k \), we can use a hash map (or dictionary) to track the counts of each number. This allows us to efficiently find the complement of each number (i.e., \( k - \text{number} \)) and determine if a valid pair can be formed.

### Approach

1. **Use a Hash Map**:
   - Create a dictionary to store the count of each number in the array.
   - Iterate through each number in the array and for each number:
     - Calculate its complement as \( k - \text{number} \).
     - Check if the complement is in the dictionary and has a count greater than zero.
     - If so, form a pair and decrement the counts of both the number and its complement.
     - If not, increment the count of the number in the dictionary.
   - Track the number of valid pairs formed.

2. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array, as we only make a single pass through the array and dictionary operations (insertion, lookup, and deletion) are on average \( O(1) \).
   - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the counts in the dictionary.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code for the described approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        operations = 0

        for num in nums:
            complement = k - num
            if complement in count and count[complement] > 0:
                operations += 1
                count[complement] -= 1
            else:
                if num in count:
                    count[num] += 1
                else:
                    count[num] = 1

        return operations
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize**:
   - `count` dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each number.
   - `operations` to count the number of valid pairs formed.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For each number, compute its complement as \( k - \text{num} \).
   - Check if the complement exists in the dictionary with a positive count.
   - If the complement exists:
     - Increment the `operations` counter.
     - Decrement the count of the complement in the dictionary.
   - If the complement does not exist:
     - Increment the count of the current number in the dictionary.

3. **Return**:
   - After processing all numbers, return the total number of operations.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum number of pairs whose sums equal \( k \) by leveraging the fast lookup capabilities of a hash map, making it suitable for large input sizes.
