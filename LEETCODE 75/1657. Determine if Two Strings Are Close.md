To determine if two strings `word1` and `word2` are close, we need to check if we can transform one string into the other using the specified operations:

1. **Swap any two existing characters**: This means the order of characters can be rearranged freely.
2. **Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character**: This means we can change all instances of a character to another character as long as both characters exist in the string.

From these operations, we can derive a few key observations:

1. **Character Set**: Both strings must have the same set of characters. If they don't, transforming one into the other is impossible.
2. **Character Frequencies**: After potentially transforming characters, the frequency of the characters in both strings must be the same, though the specific characters can be different. For example, transforming all 'a's to 'b's or vice versa.

### Plan

1. **Check if Both Strings Have the Same Set of Characters**: Convert both strings to sets of characters and compare.
2. **Check if Both Strings Have the Same Frequency of Characters**: Use a dictionary or a `Counter` to count character frequencies, then compare the sorted lists of these frequencies.

### Implementation

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Check if both words have the same set of characters
        if set(word1) != set(word2):
            return False
        
        # Step 2: Check if both words have the same frequency of characters
        count1 = Counter(word1)
        count2 = Counter(word2)
        
        return sorted(count1.values()) == sorted(count2.values())

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.closeStrings("abc", "bca"))  # Output: true
# print(sol.closeStrings("a", "aa"))  # Output: false
# print(sol.closeStrings("cabbba", "abbccc"))  # Output: true
```

### Explanation

1. **Character Set Check**: 
   - `set(word1) != set(word2)`: This ensures both strings have exactly the same characters. If they don't, we return `false`.

2. **Character Frequency Check**:
   - `Counter(word1)` and `Counter(word2)`: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to get the frequency of each character in both strings.
   - `sorted(count1.values()) == sorted(count2.values())`: We sort and compare the frequencies of characters in both strings. If they match, it means we can potentially rearrange and transform the characters to make the strings equivalent.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the longer string. This complexity arises from sorting the frequency counts.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for storing the character counts.

This method ensures that we efficiently determine whether two strings are close by leveraging set operations and frequency counts.
