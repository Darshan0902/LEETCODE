### Problem Context
The goal of the `minOperations` method is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to each box. The input `boxes` is a string where each character is either `'0'` (no ball) or `'1'` (a ball). For each box, we need to determine how many moves it would take to gather all the balls in that box.

## code : 

```.py
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(boxes)
        left = [0] * n
        right = [0] * n
        count = int(boxes[0])

        for i in range(1, n):
            left[i] = left[i - 1] + count

            if boxes[i] == '1':
                count += 1

        count = int(boxes[-1])

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            right[i] = right[i + 1] + count
            
            if boxes[i] == '1':
                count += 1

        return [left[i] + right[i] for i in range(n)]
```        

### Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
```
- We define a method `minOperations` inside the `Solution` class. This method takes a string `boxes` as input and returns a list of integers.

```python
n = len(boxes)
```
- We get the length of the `boxes` string and store it in the variable `n`.

```python
left = [0] * n
right = [0] * n
```
- We initialize two lists, `left` and `right`, each of size `n`, filled with zeros. These lists will store the number of operations needed to move balls from the left and right sides, respectively.

```python
count = int(boxes[0])
```
- We initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the number of balls seen so far. We start by checking the first box. If the first box contains a ball, `count` will be set to 1; otherwise, it will be 0.

### Left Pass
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    left[i] = left[i - 1] + count
    if boxes[i] == '1':
        count += 1
```
- We iterate from the second box (index 1) to the last box (index `n-1`).
- `left[i] = left[i - 1] + count`: For each box `i`, we calculate the number of moves required to bring all the balls from the left side to this box. This is the cumulative moves of the previous box plus the current count of balls.
- If the current box contains a ball (`boxes[i] == '1'`), we increment the `count` because we've encountered another ball.

### Right Pass
```python
count = int(boxes[-1])
```
- We reset the `count` to check the last box. If the last box contains a ball, `count` will be set to 1; otherwise, it will be 0.

```python
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    right[i] = right[i + 1] + count
    if boxes[i] == '1':
        count += 1
```
- We iterate from the second-to-last box (index `n-2`) to the first box (index 0).
- `right[i] = right[i + 1] + count`: For each box `i`, we calculate the number of moves required to bring all the balls from the right side to this box. This is the cumulative moves of the next box plus the current count of balls.
- If the current box contains a ball (`boxes[i] == '1'`), we increment the `count` because we've encountered another ball.

### Combine Results
```python
return [left[i] + right[i] for i in range(n)]
```
- Finally, we combine the results from the `left` and `right` lists. For each box `i`, the total number of moves is the sum of moves from the left and right sides. We return this combined list as the result.

### Summary
This algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of moves required to gather all balls in each box by using two passes (left and right) to accumulate the necessary operations. The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `boxes` string, because we iterate through the string a constant number of times. The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional space used for the `left` and `right` lists.
