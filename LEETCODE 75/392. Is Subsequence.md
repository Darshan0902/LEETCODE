To determine if a string \( s \) is a subsequence of another string \( t \), we can use a two-pointer technique. This method ensures that we check each character in \( s \) against the characters in \( t \) while maintaining their relative order.

### Approach

1. **Two-pointer technique**:
   - Use two pointers, one for each string: `pointer_s` for \( s \) and `pointer_t` for \( t \).
   - Traverse the string \( t \) with `pointer_t`. Each time a character in \( t \) matches the current character in \( s \) (pointed to by `pointer_s`), move the pointer in \( s \) (`pointer_s`) to the next character.
   - If `pointer_s` reaches the end of \( s \), it means all characters in \( s \) were found in \( t \) in the correct order.

2. **Termination**:
   - If `pointer_s` reaches the end of \( s \), return `true`.
   - If `pointer_t` reaches the end of \( t \) without `pointer_s` reaching the end of \( s \), return `false`.

This method works in linear time, \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) is the length of \( s \) and \( m \) is the length of \( t \).

### Code Implementation

Here's the Python code for this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        pointer_s, pointer_t = 0, 0

        while pointer_t < len(t):
            if pointer_s < len(s) and s[pointer_s] == t[pointer_t]:
                pointer_s += 1
            pointer_t += 1

        return pointer_s == len(s)
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pointer_s` and `pointer_t` are initialized to 0, pointing to the start of \( s \) and \( t \) respectively.

2. **Traversal and Matching**:
   - The loop continues until `pointer_t` has traversed all of \( t \).
   - When characters at `pointer_s` and `pointer_t` match, `pointer_s` is incremented to check the next character in \( s \).
   - `pointer_t` is always incremented to continue checking the next character in \( t \).

3. **Check Completion**:
   - After the loop, if `pointer_s` has reached the length of \( s \), it means all characters in \( s \) have been matched in \( t \) in order, hence return `true`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

### Follow-up: Optimized for Multiple `s` Checks

When there are many strings \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k \) to check against a single \( t \), pre-processing \( t \) can optimize the solution. One efficient way is to use a map of character positions for \( t \).

1. **Pre-process \( t \)**:
   - Create a dictionary where each key is a character and the value is a list of indices where the character appears in \( t \).

2. **Binary Search for Matching**:
   - For each character in \( s \), use binary search to find its position in the list of indices and ensure the order is maintained.

Hereâ€™s how to implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import bisect

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        char_positions = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Preprocess t to map characters to their positions
        for index, char in enumerate(t):
            char_positions[char].append(index)
        
        # Check each character in s
        current_pos = -1  # Initialize current position before the start of t
        for char in s:
            if char not in char_positions:
                return False  # If the character is not in t at all
            
            # List of positions where char appears in t
            positions_list = char_positions[char]
            
            # Use binary search to find the first position greater than current_pos
            next_pos_index = bisect.bisect_right(positions_list, current_pos)
            if next_pos_index == len(positions_list):
                return False  # No valid position found
            
            # Update current_pos to the found position
            current_pos = positions_list[next_pos_index]
        
        return True
```

### Explanation

1. **Pre-process \( t \)**:
   - Use `defaultdict(list)` to store lists of positions for each character in \( t \).

2. **Binary Search for Matching**:
   - For each character in \( s \), use `bisect.bisect_right` to find the next position in \( t \) that is greater than the current position.
   - If no valid position is found, return `false`.

This approach optimizes checking each string \( s_i \) against \( t \), especially useful when \( k \) is large.
