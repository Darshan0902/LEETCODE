### Problem Context
The goal of the `gcdOfStrings` method is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings `str1` and `str2`. The GCD of two strings is the largest string `X` that can divide both `str1` and `str2` such that both strings can be formed by concatenating `X` some number of times.

### Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
```
- We define a method `gcdOfStrings` inside the `Solution` class. This method takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as input and returns a string representing their greatest common divisor.

### Check for Valid Concatenation
```python
if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
    return ""
```
- First, we check if the concatenation of `str1` and `str2` is the same as the concatenation of `str2` and `str1`.
- If `str1 + str2` is not equal to `str2 + str1`, it means that there is no common substring `X` that can be concatenated to form both `str1` and `str2`. Hence, we return an empty string `""`.

### Calculate the GCD of the Lengths
```python
from math import gcd
```
- We import the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.

```python
return str1[:gcd(len(str1), len(str2))]
```
- We use the `gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
- We then return the substring of `str1` from the beginning to the length equal to the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.

### How It Works
1. **Concatenation Check:**
   - This check ensures that a common divisor string exists. If `str1` and `str2` can be formed by some common string `X`, then their concatenations in different orders should be the same (`str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`).

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The length of the greatest common divisor string `X` will be the greatest common divisor of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
   - We then extract the substring of this length from `str1`.

### Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate:

```python
str1 = "ABCABC"
str2 = "ABC"
```

1. **Concatenation Check:**
   - `str1 + str2` results in `"ABCABCABC"`.
   - `str2 + str1` results in `"ABCABCABC"`.
   - Since `str1 + str2` is equal to `str2 + str1`, we proceed.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - Length of `str1` is 6.
   - Length of `str2` is 3.
   - GCD of 6 and 3 is 3.

3. **Extract GCD String:**
   - The substring of `str1` from the beginning to length 3 is `"ABC"`.

Therefore, the greatest common divisor string is `"ABC"`.

### Summary
This algorithm efficiently determines the greatest common divisor of two strings by leveraging properties of string concatenation and the mathematical GCD function. The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively, due to the concatenation check. The space complexity is O(1) for the additional space used, aside from the input and output.




## Code : 


```.py

class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        # Check if concatenated strings are equal or not, if not return ""
        if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
            return ""
        # If strings are equal than return the substring from 0 to gcd of size(str1), size(str2)
        from math import gcd
        return str1[:gcd(len(str1), len(str2))]


```
