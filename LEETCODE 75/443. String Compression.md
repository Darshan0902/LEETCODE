To solve the problem of compressing an array of characters using constant extra space, we need to follow a few steps:

1. Traverse the array and identify consecutive groups of characters.
2. For each group, if the length of the group is greater than 1, append the character followed by the length of the group.
3. Modify the input array in-place to reflect the compressed format and return the new length of the array.

Let's break down the approach step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: Use two pointers, one (`write`) to keep track of where to write in the array and another (`read`) to read through the array.
2. **Iterate through the array**: For each character, count how many times it repeats consecutively.
3. **Write the character and count**: Write the character to the `write` position. If the count of that character is more than 1, convert the count to a string and write each digit of the string to the `write` position.
4. **Return the new length**: After processing all characters, the `write` pointer will indicate the length of the compressed array.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write = 0  # Pointer to write the compressed string
        read = 0   # Pointer to read through the original array
        
        while read < len(chars):
            char = chars[read]
            count = 0
            
            # Count the number of occurrences of the current character
            while read < len(chars) and chars[read] == char:
                read += 1
                count += 1
            
            # Write the character to the write position
            chars[write] = char
            write += 1
            
            # If the character count is more than 1, write the count as well
            if count > 1:
                for digit in str(count):
                    chars[write] = digit
                    write += 1
        
        return write
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `write` is initialized to 0. This pointer will track where to write the compressed characters in the array.
   - `read` is initialized to 0. This pointer will iterate through the input array.

2. **Counting consecutive characters**:
   - For each character at position `read`, count how many times it repeats consecutively.
   - Increment the `read` pointer and the `count` for each consecutive character.

3. **Writing to the array**:
   - Write the character to the position indicated by the `write` pointer and increment the `write` pointer.
   - If the `count` is greater than 1, convert the count to a string and write each character of this string to the array, incrementing the `write` pointer for each character.

4. **Returning the length**:
   - After the loop completes, the `write` pointer will be at the position just after the last character of the compressed string. The value of `write` is the new length of the compressed array.

This algorithm ensures that the input array is modified in place with constant extra space, as required. The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input array, because each character is processed a constant number of times. The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as no extra space proportional to the input size is used.
