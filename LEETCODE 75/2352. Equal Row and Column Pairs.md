To solve the problem of finding the number of equal row and column pairs in an `n x n` matrix, we need to compare each row with each column to see if they are identical. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

### Approach

1. **Extract Rows and Columns**: We'll extract the rows as they are and construct the columns from the given grid.
2. **Compare Rows and Columns**: We will use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each row and then compare these rows against each column to count how many columns match any of the rows.

### Steps

1. **Extract Rows**: Rows are already given directly in the grid.
2. **Construct Columns**: For each column index, gather elements from each row to form the column.
3. **Count Rows**: Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each row.
4. **Compare with Columns**: For each column, check if it matches any row by looking up the row in the dictionary.

### Implementation

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        
        # Step 1: Extract rows
        rows = [tuple(grid[i]) for i in range(n)]
        
        # Step 2: Construct columns
        columns = [tuple(grid[j][i] for j in range(n)) for i in range(n)]
        
        # Step 3: Count occurrences of each row
        row_count = defaultdict(int)
        for row in rows:
            row_count[row] += 1
        
        # Step 4: Count how many columns match any of the rows
        count = 0
        for column in columns:
            if column in row_count:
                count += row_count[column]
        
        return count

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.equalPairs([[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]))  # Output: 1
# print(sol.equalPairs([[3,1,2,2],[1,4,4,5],[2,4,2,2],[2,4,2,2]]))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Extract Rows**: We convert each row to a tuple and store it in the list `rows`. Using a tuple ensures that the rows can be used as dictionary keys.
2. **Construct Columns**: For each column index `i`, we build a tuple of elements from each row `j` at index `i` to form the column.
3. **Count Rows**: We use a `defaultdict` to count the number of occurrences of each row.
4. **Count Matching Columns**: For each column, we check if it exists in our `row_count` dictionary and increment our count by the number of times that row appears.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the dimension of the grid. We iterate through the grid to extract rows and columns and then compare each column to rows.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), for storing rows, columns, and the dictionary of row counts.

This method efficiently counts the number of pairs of rows and columns that are identical in an `n x n` grid.
