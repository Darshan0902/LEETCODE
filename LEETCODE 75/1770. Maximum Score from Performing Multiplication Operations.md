### Problem Context
The `maximumScore` method aims to maximize the score obtained by multiplying elements from the `nums` list with elements from the `muls` list according to a specific set of rules. We can either pick elements from the beginning (left) or the end (right) of the `nums` list in a way that maximizes the score.

### Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, nums: List[int], muls: List[int]) -> int:
```
- We define a method `maximumScore` inside the `Solution` class. This method takes two lists of integers, `nums` and `muls`, and returns an integer representing the maximum score.

```python
n, m = len(nums), len(muls)
```
- We determine the lengths of the `nums` and `muls` lists and store them in variables `n` and `m`, respectively.

### Memoization with `@lru_cache`
```python
@lru_cache(2000)
def dp(l, i):
```
- We define an inner function `dp` (dynamic programming) with the `@lru_cache` decorator to memoize results and avoid redundant calculations. This decorator allows us to store up to 2000 results.
- The `dp` function takes two parameters: `l` (the current left index) and `i` (the current index in the `muls` list).

### Base Case
```python
if i == m: return 0
```
- If we have processed all elements in the `muls` list (`i == m`), we return 0 because no more operations are possible.

### Recursive Cases
```python
pickLeft = dp(l+1, i+1) + nums[l] * muls[i] # Pick the left side
pickRight = dp(l, i+1) + nums[n-(i-l)-1] * muls[i] # Pick the right side
```
- **Pick the Left Side:**
  - We calculate the score if we pick the leftmost element of the current subarray of `nums`. This involves moving the left index `l` one step to the right (`l+1`) and moving to the next multiplier (`i+1`).
  - The score for this move is `dp(l+1, i+1) + nums[l] * muls[i]`.
- **Pick the Right Side:**
  - We calculate the score if we pick the rightmost element of the current subarray of `nums`. The rightmost element is `nums[n-(i-l)-1]`.
  - We do not change the left index `l`, but we move to the next multiplier (`i+1`).
  - The score for this move is `dp(l, i+1) + nums[n-(i-l)-1] * muls[i]`.

```python
return max(pickLeft, pickRight)
```
- We return the maximum score possible between picking from the left side and picking from the right side.

### Final Result
```python
return dp(0, 0)
```
- We initiate the dynamic programming process by calling `dp(0, 0)`, which starts with the left index at 0 and the first multiplier.

### Summary
This algorithm uses a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum score by considering all possible ways to pick elements from the `nums` list using elements from the `muls` list. The time complexity is reduced due to the memoization provided by `@lru_cache`, which avoids redundant calculations. The space complexity is primarily determined by the cache size and the recursive stack depth.
