# Intuition
To determine if there exists a subarray with a sum divisible by k, we can use the property that if the cumulative sum of elements from index i to j is divisible by k, then the subarray sum from index i to j is divisible by k. So, we can keep track of the cumulative sum modulo k for each index. If we encounter the same remainder again, it means there exists a subarray whose sum is divisible by k.


# Approach
The approach is to iterate through the array, calculating the cumulative sum modulo k for each index. We maintain a hashmap to store the remainders encountered along with their corresponding indices. If we encounter the same remainder again, it means there exists a subarray whose sum is divisible by k. We also need to ensure that the subarray has at least two elements (as per the problem statement).

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
𝑂(𝑛)
O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.

- Space complexity:
O(min(n,k)), where n is the length of the input array nums and k is the input integer k.

# Code
```.py
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        remainder_map = {0: -1}  
        cumulative_sum = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            cumulative_sum += num
            remainder = cumulative_sum % k
            if remainder in remainder_map:
                if i - remainder_map[remainder] > 1:
                    return True
            else:
                remainder_map[remainder] = i
        return False
```
