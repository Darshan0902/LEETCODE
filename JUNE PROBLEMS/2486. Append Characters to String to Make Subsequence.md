# 2486. **Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence**:
---

# Intuition
The problem asks for the minimum number of characters we need to append to the end of string s to make t a subsequence of s.
A subsequence means that we can remove some or no elements from s without changing the order of the remaining elements to get t.
---
# Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique. We will iterate through both strings using two pointers:

One pointer (s_index) to traverse string s.
Another pointer (t_index) to traverse string t.
The goal is to match as many characters of t as possible with characters in s in their respective order. If a character in 
s matches the current character in t, we move the t_index to the next character. If they do not match, we just move the s_index to the next character in s.

After we traverse through s, if t_index has not reached the end of t, it means there are still characters left in t that were not matched. 
The number of such characters will be the number of characters we need to append to s.

# Complexity

* **Time complexity:**
O(n+m), where 
𝑛 is the length of s and 
𝑚 is the length of t. We traverse both strings once.


* **Space complexity**:
 𝑂(1)as we are using a constant amount of extra space.>

# Code
```.py
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        s_index , t_index = 0,0
        s_length,t_length = len(s),len(t)

        while s_index < s_length and t_index < t_length:
            if s[s_index] == t[t_index]:
                t_index+=1
            s_index+=1

        return t_length - t_index

```
