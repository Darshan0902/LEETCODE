# Intuition
* The goal is to replace words in the sentence with their shortest root from the dictionary.
* We use a set for fast lookups to determine if a prefix is a root.
* For each word in the sentence, we check its prefixes and replace it with the shortest matching root.

# Approach
1. Create Set of Roots:
Convert the dictionary into a set for quick lookups.

2. Process Each Word:
Split the sentence into words.
For each word, iterate over its prefixes to find the shortest root in the set.
3. Construct Result Sentence:
Build the result sentence by appending each found prefix or the word itself if no prefix is found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```.py
class Solution(object):
    def replaceWords(self, dictionary, sentence):
        rootSet = set(dictionary)

        def findRoot(word):
            for i in range(1, len(word) + 1):
                prefix = word[:i]
                if prefix in rootSet:
                    return prefix
            return word
        
        words = sentence.split()
        replacedWords = [findRoot(word) for word in words]

        return ' '.join(replacedWords)


```
