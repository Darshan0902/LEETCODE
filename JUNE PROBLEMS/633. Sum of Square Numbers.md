To determine if a given non-negative integer \( c \) can be expressed as the sum of two squared integers, we can use properties of number theory. The problem essentially asks if \( c \) can be written in the form \( a^2 + b^2 \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers.

# Intuition
The solution revolves around number theory, specifically the properties of prime factors and sums of squares. A number can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form \( 4k+3 \) (where \( k \) is an integer) appears with an even exponent.

# Approach
1. **Prime Factorization Check**: Iterate over possible divisors to factorize the number \( c \).
2. **Exponent Analysis**: For each prime factor, especially those of the form \( 4k+3 \), check if their exponents are even.
3. **Final Check**: If any prime factor of the form \( 4k+3 \) has an odd exponent, \( c \) cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \( O(\sqrt{c}) \) - This is because we are checking divisors up to \( \sqrt{c} \).
- **Space complexity**: \( O(1) \) - The space used does not scale with the input size.

Here's the implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        # Edge case: if c is less than 0, it can't be a sum of two squares
        if c < 0:
            return False
        
        # Start checking from the smallest prime divisor
        divisor = 2
        
        # We only need to check up to the square root of c
        while divisor * divisor <= c:
            # Check if the current divisor is a factor of c
            if c % divisor == 0:
                exponentCount = 0
                # Count the number of times this divisor divides c
                while c % divisor == 0:
                    exponentCount += 1
                    c //= divisor
                # If the divisor is of the form 4k+3 and appears an odd number of times
                if divisor % 4 == 3 and exponentCount % 2 != 0:
                    return False
            divisor += 1
        
        # After factorization, if the remaining c is a prime of the form 4k+3, it must appear with an even exponent
        return c % 4 != 3

```

This method carefully checks the conditions necessary for \( c \) to be expressible as a sum of two squares based on its prime factorization. If the remaining \( c \) after factorization is a prime of the form \( 4k+3 \), it must appear with an even exponent for \( c \) to be expressible as the sum of two squares.
