# Intuition
You're likely considering the cumulative sum of the elements in the array and using the properties of modulus to find subarrays divisible by 
𝑘.

# Approach
Your approach utilizes a counter to keep track of the cumulative sums modulo k encountered so far. By maintaining this counter, you can efficiently count the number of subarrays divisible by k.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.

- Space complexity:
O(k), where k is the value of the divisor. The space required is proportional to the number of distinct remainders encountered while iterating through the array.

# Code
```.py
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        cnt = Counter({0: 1})
        ans = s = 0
        for x in nums:
            s = (s + x) % k
            ans += cnt[s]
            cnt[s] += 1
        return ans
```
